Python(x,y) is a free scientific and engineering development software for
numerical computations, data analysis and data visualization based on
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language,
[Qt](http://www.trolltech.com) graphical user interfaces and
[Spyder](http://spyderlib.googlecode.com/) interactive scientific development
environment.

With Python(x,y), one can do:
  * interactive calculations including for example 2D and 3D plotting or symbolic maths,
  * simple functionnal programming (with MATLAB-like syntax) as well as powerful object-oriented programming,
  * scientific projects development from the simplest script to the most sophisticated application thanks to Qt development framework and Spyder development environment,
  * parallel computing on multicore/processors computers or even clusters (with Parallel Python),
...and a lot more!

### What is exactly Python(x,y)?

Python(x,y) is a scientific-oriented Python Distribution based on Qt and Spyder
- see the [Plugins](Plugins.md) page. Its purpose is to help scientific programmers used to
interpreted languages (such as MATLAB or IDL) or compiled languages (C/C++ or
Fortran) to switch to Python. C/C++ or Fortran programmers should appreciate to
reuse their code "as is" by wrapping it so it can be called directly from Python
scripts.

### Main features

Python(x,y) has five main features:
  * collecting scientific-oriented Python libraries and development environment tools ;
  * collecting almost all free related documentation ;
  * providing a quick guide to get started in Python / Qt / Spyder ;
  * providing an all-in-one setup program, so the user can install or uninstall all these packages and features by clicking on one button only.


### Why Python?

In many ways, Python is far more superior to other scientific languages: it's a
general-purpose language (e.g. with powerful GUI, I/O, internet, and database
libraries), it's free and open-source, fundamentally object-oriented,
very portable, extensible and embeddable, and so on. However, Python libraries
generally suffer from a lack of documentation, even if the growing community
contributes everyday with detailed tutorials on many topics.


### Why a Python distribution for scientists?

Because testing all libraries, choosing the right one for the right usage,
and grabbing all the free documentation on the internet takes time. Moreover,
one needs some perspective to elaborate its own coherent development framework
(i.e. Python libraries and development environment).

Python(x,y) was created for :
  * rapid prototyping, using the enhanced Python shell known as IPython ;
  * small/big projects (application-like) development, using Spyder - a powerful and interactive cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ;
  * scientific purpose: scientific computing, numerical simulations, signal processing, image processing, physics (experiments and modeling), engineering, ...


### Why Qt?

We strongly recommend using
[PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) for Graphical
User Interface (GUI) development, since it is a very powerful and easy-to-use
library – Mark Summerfield’s book is the best way to get  started with
[PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) (it is also a
very good, very effective introduction to the Python language).
For scientific programs, note that matplotlib figures (mainly 2D graphics) can
be embedded in [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
applications window, almost as easily as in MATLAB.

I hope that this distribution can help people to better understand the inner
advantages of Python for scientific computing.
